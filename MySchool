        <h2>APS Hamza</h2>

        <p>
            My school is one of the branches of the infamous <mark>Army Public Schools</mark> in <b><i>Pakistan.</i></b><br> 
            It is loacted in <b><u>Rawalpindi, Punjab.</u></b><br> 
            APS hamza's students are distinct and vast in culture and religion, but despite the differnces, every student treats thier classmate with kindness and respect.<br>
            That is a sign of <b>good education.</b><br><hr>

            Moreover, my school is registered to <em><b>FBISE board</b></em> and uses the books of fedral boad as-well.<br><hr>

            Lastly, APS Hamza focuses solely on <i><b>education and academic records</b></i> whilst also keeping students engaged with <i><b>extra curriculars.</b></i>
